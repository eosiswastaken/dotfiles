this repo is where I keep a backup of all my dotfiles, and config files for various software I use. I also keep a list of packages I installed and a quickstart guide, so that my whole development toolchain can be as os-agnostic as it can be.
feel free to copy my dotfiles (even though they are tailored to my needs), or take some bits for yourself.

want more info about my uses and setup ? use the `setup` command on my [personnal webpage](https://eosis.space)

this is the list of packages I use, not all of them have config files.

sudo apt update

‚ö†Ô∏è some packages will need to be set up manually before copying dotfiles
